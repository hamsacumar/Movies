        The command npm install bootstrap is used to install Bootstrap, a widely-used 
        CSS framework, into your JavaScript project. This command downloads Bootstrapâ€™s files, 
        which include pre-designed CSS styles and JavaScript components that make it easy to create 
        a responsive, mobile-first website. Once installed, Bootstrap is saved in your project's node_modules 
        folder, and an entry is added to your package.json file to keep track of it as a project dependency. 
        After installation, you can import Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript into your project files to start using 
        its styles and components, streamlining the design process significantly.
